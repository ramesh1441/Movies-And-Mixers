# Movies & Mixers
Do you to watch a movie and enjoy an alcoholic beverage but can't make up your mind either way? Adults over the age of 21 can use this application to get a recommendation for both! Simply click the button for what you are in the mood for and a movie and cocktail will generate below!

## User Story
-As a user over the age of 21
-I want a movie recommended to me after inputting my personal preferences
-Then, I want a cocktail suggestion for the movie that was recommended

## How it works
By using a movie database API, we were able to pull movies based on Genre and output the title, decription, movie poster, and a link to watch in iTunes.

By using a cocktail database API, we were able to sort drinks by alcohol and then assign them to the relative movie genre (example: a romantic movie will generate with a wine or champagne cocktail) and then output a recipe and a picture of the drink.
